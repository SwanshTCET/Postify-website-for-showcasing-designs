Tried Something New! Embracing Creativity with "Build Don't Talk"ðŸ’¡

Inspired by Raj Shamani's book, I took the leap and recreated the cover in my own style.

Trying new things sparks innovation! Cheers to embracing creativity, in our own unique way! ðŸŒŸ

I Tried Something New and Here's What Happened 
I recently read Raj Shamani's book, Build Don't Talk, and I was inspired by his message to "try new things and see if they're for you." So, I decided to try my hand at reframing the book's cover page.

I'm sharing my social media post here to get feedback from others. I'm curious to know what you think of my design, and if you have any suggestions for how I could improve it.

I also want to share this post as a way of encouraging others to try new things. If you're feeling stuck or uninspired, I challenge you to step outside of your comfort zone and try something new. You might be surprised at what you're capable of.
